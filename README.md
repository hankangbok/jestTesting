# Jest Javascript practice
This project contains some javascript functions, and a file that uses Jest to test if the functions run as desired.

### The test functions include:
- <b>sum</b> - sums 2 numbers and returns the result.  
- <b>capitalize</b> - capitalizes the first letter in a string.  
- <b>reverseString </b>- reverses a given string.   
- <b>calculator (future) </b>- adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides two given numbers.  
- <b>caesarCipher (future) </b>- Given a string and a 'shift' amount, this function encrypts the given string by 'shifting' each letter in the alphabet by the given shift 'K'.  

### To use: 
- Clone the repository
- In the terminal, run 
```
  yarn test
```
or 
```
  npm test --watch
```
## Future updates:
CaesarCipher: Ensure that mixed-case strings are correctly converted.
~~CaesarCipher: Successfully convert strings including punctuation~~
~~CaesarCipher: Successfully convert strings including whitespace~~
~~All functions: Run tests to make sure that blank strings, argumentless passes are accounted for.~~

## Technologies Used: 
JavaScript, Jest, npm
