# Jest Javascript practice
This project contains some javascript functions, and a file that uses Jest to test if the functions run as desired.

### The test functions include:
sum - sums 2 numbers and returns the result.
capitalize - capitalizes the first letter in a string.
reverseString - reverses a given string. 
calculator (future) - adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides two given numbers.
caesarCipher (future) - Given a string and a 'shift' amount, this function encrypts the given string by 'shifting' each letter in the alphabet by the given shift 'K'

### To use: 
- Clone the repository
- In the terminal, run 
```
  yarn test
```
or 
```
  npm test --watch
```
